# Welcome to OpenTekHub Blockchain Repository üöÄ

This repository allows you to explore cryptocurrency price predictions using JavaScript and an API integration (CoinGecko). The project is designed to help you understand how to fetch and display real-time data, specifically cryptocurrency prices, by integrating external APIs into a web application.

## üåü What You Will Learn:
- HTML Structure: Basic layout of a web application.
- JavaScript API Integration: How to fetch data from external APIs (CoinGecko).
- CSS Styling: Applying modern styles with a clean design using Flexbox and responsive layouts.
- Interactive UI: Implementing input-based suggestions and dynamic content updates.
- Predict Cryptocurrency Prices: Learn how to predict and display live cryptocurrency prices based on user input.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites:
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. In your terminal, type the following command:
```terminal
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/blockchain.git
```

### Step 2: Understand the Project Structure
Once cloned, explore the folder structure:

- index.html: The main HTML page for your web application.
- styles.css: Contains all the styling for your application.
- script.js: Includes the JavaScript logic to fetch cryptocurrency prices and handle user input.


### Step 3: Setting Up the HTML
In the index.html file, the structure of the webpage is defined. This includes:

- A header for the project title.
- A crypto price prediction section with input and a button to fetch prices.
- Repository Information with a link to the GitHub repository.

You don‚Äôt need to change anything here unless you want to add more features.

### Step 4: Style Your Webpage (CSS)
The styles in styles.css make your web app look modern and responsive.

Key points:

- The gradient background and clean typography provide a sleek look.
- Responsive design using media queries ensures the app works on all devices, from mobile to desktop.

If you want to experiment with the styles, open styles.css and modify.

### Step 5: JavaScript Logic (API Integration)
Now, the core part! The script.js file contains JavaScript code that fetches cryptocurrency prices using the CoinGecko API and displays them dynamically on the webpage.

- Crypto Suggestions: As the user types a symbol, suggestions are shown.
- API Fetching: After clicking "Predict Price", it fetches the price from the CoinGecko API.

Here's the key JavaScript code for fetching the price:

```terminal
    fetch(`https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=${crypto}&vs_currencies=usd`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        document.getElementById("price").innerText = "$" + data[crypto].usd;
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error:", error);
    });
```
### Step 6: Testing the Application
To see the application in action:

- Open index.html in your browser (double-click the file).
- Type a cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin, ETH for Ethereum).
- Click "Predict Price" to see the current price.

### Step 7: Expanding the Project
Here are some ideas to expand the project:

- Add more cryptocurrencies to the cryptoMap object in script.js.
- Enhance the UI with more visuals, such as cryptocurrency logos or charts.
- Improve Error Handling by providing better feedback if the API fails or the symbol isn't valid.
